"""
This module provides utilities to work with Protobuf descriptors.

Many of these utilities trade in terms of paths and locations.

Paths are sequences of numbers that identify an arbitrarily nested field in a Protobuf message.
Each part of a path is one or two numbers: the field number if it is not a repeated field, and
the field number and item index if it is. For example, ``[4, 1, 3]`` can be (but it ultimately
depends on the concrete Protobuf message type) a path to the third item of field number 1 of
the message field number 4.

Locations refer to portions of a .proto source file. Locations specify a path to the descriptors
of the constructs that are defined in the corresponding portion. See
[``SourceCodeInfo``](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/main/benchmarks/descriptor.proto#L710)
message description for further reference.
