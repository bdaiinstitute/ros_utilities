    Example entrypoint.

    It is configured almost as a prebaked ROS 2 aware process. That is, including a
    process-wide (ie. globally accessible) node, an autoscaling multi-threaded executor
    running in a background thread, automatic ``logging`` logs forwarding to the ROS 2
    logging system, and implicit namespacing for all ROS 2 nodes loaded in it based on
    the executable basename. A convenience for simple executables that need to use ROS 2
    without having to worry about ROS 2 (or its fallout, e.g. accidental deadblocking).

    When executed, an action server node is loaded, and the process-wide node is used to
    setup an action client. This action client is then used to implement a simple console
    application.
