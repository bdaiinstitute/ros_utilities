# Protobuf to ROS 2 interoperability 

`proto2ros` helps maintain an interoperability layer between Protobuf dependent and ROS 2 aware code by generating equivalent ROS 2 message definitions given source Protobuf message definitions, as well bi-directional conversion APIs in relevant languages (such as Python). To date, Protobuf syntax versions 2 and 3 are supported but only syntax version 3 has been extensively tested.
