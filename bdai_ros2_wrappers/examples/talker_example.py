    Example entrypoint, taking command-line arguments.

    It is configured as a regular ROS 2 aware process. That is, no process-wide node,
    no background autoscaling multi-threaded executor, no log forwarding to the ROS 2
    logging system, and no implicit node namespacing. In other words, a run-off-the-mill
    executable that uses ROS 2.

    When executed, a single `TalkerNode` is instantiated and spinned in foreground, on
    an implicitly instantiated autoscaling multi-threaded executor. This will continue
    indefinitely until the executable is interrupted (e.g. by a SIGINT on Ctrl + C).
